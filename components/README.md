# React sass starterkit #

This is an opinionated frontend development kit.
It includes a small scaffolder for react components and is exporting a bundle with a global variable named Components

## Installation ##

1. npm install
2. npm scaffold
3. npm start

This will create a base set of containers and components in the app folder that you can work with and start the devserver at [http://localhost:7000](http://localhost:7000).

`npm run storybook`
